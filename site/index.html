			Dosa
		</div>
		<p>
			<strong><b>RECIPE DIRECTIONS</b></strong>
			<br><br>
			<ol> 
			<li>Wash all the ingredients, except for the oil, three or four times, then drain. Leave to soak in cold water in a bowl overnight.</li>
			<br>
			<li>Drain the water from the ingredients, but keep it and set aside. Transfer the soaked ingredients to a food processor and grind to make a smooth paste. Make sure the batter doesn't look grainy â€“ you can use a little of the soaking water if you need to. It should be like a thick, smooth pancake batter and should coat the back of a spoon. Empty into a large bowl and cover. Keep it in a warm place overnight to allow the batter to ferment (see tip, below). It will have doubled in quantity and look bubbly. If you're not using the batter straight away, chill for later. It will keep for up to five days.</li>
			<br>
			<li>Very gently stir the batter. It will have thickened in consistency, so you can add a little water to give it a thick but pourable consistency.</li>
			<br>
			<li>Heat a non-stick frying pan on a low to medium heat for 5 mins. Drizzle over a few drops of oil, then wipe the pan with kitchen paper to get rid of any excess oil. </li>
			<br>
			<li>Sprinkle a handful of water on the hot pan to cool it, then dry with some kitchen paper. Pour one ladle of the dosa batter in the middle of the pan. Using the bottom of the ladle, quickly move it in a circular motion, allowing the batter to spread outwards from the middle towards the edge of the pan, to form a round, thin pancake.</li>
			<br>
			<li>Drizzle a few drops of oil all over the dosa and increase the temperature to a high heat. When it turns slightly golden and the edges begin to lift, add any stuffing (like dosa masala potato stuffing) to the middle. Continue to cook until the underside looks completely golden and crisp. Use a flat spatula to loosen the edges, then roll over the potato stuffing and lift onto a plate. </li>
			<br>
			<li>Before you make the next dosa, decrease the temperature of the pan back to a medium heat and repeat the above steps. </li>

			Bombay potatoes
		</div>
		<p>
			<strong><b>RECIPE DIRECTIONS</b></strong>
			<br><br>
			<ol>
			<li>Put the ginger, garlic and four tomatoes into a food processor and blitz until smooth. Set aside.</li>
			<br>
			<li>Put the potatoes in a large saucepan. Cover with cold water and bring to a simmer over a medium heat. Cook for 8-10 mins, or until just tender. Drain and leave to steam dry. </li>
			<br>
			<li>Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onions and a large pinch of salt and fry for 15 mins, or until the onions are golden and sticky. Add the chillies, mustard seeds, ground coriander, turmeric, cumin and garam masala to the pan and fry for another 2 mins. Tip in the tomato mixture and bring to a gentle simmer, then carefully stir in the potatoes and remaining tomatoes. Season to taste. Gently simmer the Bombay potatoes for a few mins until everything is warmed through, then serve topped with the coriander. </li>

			Sushi

		<p>
			<strong><b>RECIPE DIRECTIONS</b></strong>
			<br><br>
			<ol>
			<li>Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer rice to a bowl and cut in rice vinegar using a rice paddle or wooden spoon. Season with 1 teaspoon sugar and 1 teaspoon salt, or to taste. Allow to cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.</li>
			<br>
			<li>Prepare fish for wrapping by slicing against the grain into thin pieces about 2 inches long and 1 inch wide. Refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
			<br>
			<li>Whisk eggs, 1/2 teaspoon sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon salt together in a bowl. Pour about 1/4 of the mixture in a thin layer in a large greased skillet over medium heat. Cook without stirring until cooked through, about 2 to 3 minutes. Roll into a log and set in one side of the pan. Repeat with 1/4 of the egg mixture, rolling each log into a new log, to create one large log. Slice omelet on the diagonal into pieces about 1/2-inch thick.</li>
			<br>
			<li>Place a piece of fish or shrimp in your hand and smear it lightly with wasabi paste if desired. Grab 1 to 2 tablespoons of rice and roll it into a small nugget in your hand. Place the rice ball on top of the fish or shrimp, squeezing gently to make it adhere. Set aside while you assemble the remaining pieces of fish and shrimp.</li>
			<br>
			<li>Take a slice of egg omelet in your hand, grab 1 to 2 tablespoons of rice, and roll it into a small nugget in your hand. Place the rice ball on top of the egg, squeezing gently to make it adhere.</li>
			<br>
			<li>Wrap a strip of nori around each package; moisten one end of the nori strip and seal to join.</li>
